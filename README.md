Sure! Here's the complete **copy-paste version** of your GitHub `README.md` for the **Elevator Controller FSM project**:

---
🚀 Elevator Controller (Finite State Machine) – Verilog

A Verilog-based **Finite State Machine (FSM)** design for a smart elevator system. This project simulates elevator operations including **floor requests**, **directional movement**, **door control**, and **emergency stop handling**, built and tested using `Icarus Verilog` and `GTKWave`.

---

## 📌 Features

- Handles **up/down floor requests**
- Supports **target vs. current floor detection**
- Automatic **door open with timer**
- **Emergency stop** from any state
- FSM States: `IDLE`, `MOVING_UP`, `MOVING_DOWN`, `DOOR_OPEN`, `EMERGENCY_STOP`

---

## 🧠 FSM Design Overview

### 🔄 States

| State            | Meaning                                   |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `IDLE`           | Waiting for a request                     |
| `MOVING_UP`      | Elevator moving up                        |
| `MOVING_DOWN`    | Elevator moving down                      |
| `DOOR_OPEN`      | Door opens for a few cycles at target     |
| `EMERGENCY_STOP` | Elevator halted immediately               |

### ⛓️ Transitions
- Transitions depend on:
  - `up_request`, `down_request`
  - `current_floor`, `target_floor`
  - `emergency_stop` signal
  - Internal `door_timer`

## 🛠️ How to Simulate

### Prerequisites
- [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/)
- [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/)

---

### 🚦 Run Basic Testbench

```bash
iverilog -o elevator_out.vvp ElevatorController.v ElevatorController_tb.v
vvp elevator_out.vvp
gtkwave ElevatorController.vcd
````

---

### 🚨 Run Advanced Testbench (with Emergency Stop)

```bash
iverilog -o elevator_out.vvp ElevatorController.v ElevatorController_tb2.v
vvp elevator_out.vvp
gtkwave ElevatorController2.vcd
```

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage

### ✅ Basic TB

* Upward movement
* Downward movement
* Floor match and door open

### ✅ Advanced TB

* Emergency stop during idle and motion
* Door timer countdown
* Sequential requests handling

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

* Designed a multi-state FSM in Verilog
* Modeled real-time elevator control logic
* Used testbenches for behavior simulation
* Learned clock-based transitions and state encoding
* Simulated and visualized with GTKWave
